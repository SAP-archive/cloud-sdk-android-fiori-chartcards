# SAP Fiori Chart Cards Demo Application

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-sdk-android-fiori-chartcards)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-sdk-android-fiori-chartcards)

## Description

This application demonstrates how to utilize the Chart Cards views in the SAP Fiori UI library. The app is intended to provide an example implementation of these controls with a real network API data source, i.e. the [COVID Tracking APIs](https://covidtracking.com/data/api), so that users can understand how to use the SAP Fiori Chart Cards views to expand the functionality of their own applications.

If you are new to the SAP BTP SDK for Android, [Get Started with SAP BTP SDK for Android](https://developers.sap.com/mission.sdk-android-get-started.html), [Step by Step with the SAP BTP SDK for Android](https://blogs.sap.com/2018/10/15/step-by-step-with-the-sap-cloud-platform-sdk-for-android-part-1/) series, and the [SAP BTP SDK for Android Learning Journey](https://help.sap.com/doc/221f8f84afef43d29ad37ef2af0c4adf/HP_2.0/en-US/747d6d2ea0534ba99612920c7402631a.html) are great places to start.

### The Finished Product

The app makes HTTP requests to the [COVID Tracking APIs](https://covidtracking.com/data/api) to retrieve US Daily and States Current COVID-19 data. Then the data is transformed into ChartCardDataModel objects which are displayed in the Chart Cards view from the SAP Fiori UI library. In case the network service is unavailable, an offline mode allows retrieval of COVID-19 data from locally stored JSON documents.
